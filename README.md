# ![AdaptiveGrid](./build/Assets/Banner.svg)

 A powerful responsive Grid system for Avalaliona, inspired by CSS grid. Is porting of WPF [AdaptiveGrid](https://github.com/Marplex/AdaptiveGrid). It is lightweight and simple to work with, use only xaml & no code behind, build responsive layouts in seconds.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

Add your grid and define rows/columns

```xml
<ag:AdaptiveGrid>

    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>

</ag:AdaptiveGrid>
```

Define your template areas inside the ```<ag:AdaptiveGrid>```

```xml
<ag:AdaptiveGrid.TemplateAreas>

    <!-- This area is applied to the layout if the width is greater than 0 -->
    <ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea FromWidth="0">
        <ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea.Areas>

            <ag:AdaptiveGridArea Area="text1" Column="0"/>
            <ag:AdaptiveGridArea Area="text2" Column="1"/>

        </ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea.Areas>
    </ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea>


    <!-- This area is applied to the layout if the width is greater than 300 -->
    <ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea FromWidth="300">
        <ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea.Areas>

            <ag:AdaptiveGridArea Area="text1" Column="1"/>
            <ag:AdaptiveGridArea Area="text2" Column="0"/>

        </ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea.Areas>
    </ag:AdaptiveGridTemplateArea>

</ag:AdaptiveGrid.TemplateAreas>
```

Assign corresponding areas to displayed controls

```xml
<TextBlock ag:AdaptiveGrid.Area="text1"> Text1 </TextBlock>
<TextBlock ag:AdaptiveGrid.Area="text2"> Text2 </TextBlock>
```

And that's it, Text1 and Text2 will now automatically reposition themself at column 0 or column 1 depending on the Grid's width.
